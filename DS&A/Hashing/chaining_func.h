/*


Implement an ADT for a Set of strings using a hash table with quadratic probing. 
The strings are composed of a nonempty sequence of letters, digits and underscores, 
but the first character is never a digit. This implementation is meant to be 
compatible for use with the identifiers in question 2, 
but if you donâ€™t complete this question, use the code in set.h instead.
